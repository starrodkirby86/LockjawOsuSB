/*

CLASS: Raincloud
    A single raindrop object. Each raindrop is its own sprite.
    Once spawned, a raindrop will "drop" from the top of the screen
    to the bottom of the screen. This drop is actually a move command.
    Once it reaches the bottom of the screen, it will wrap back to the top.

    The x-location is randomized and is re-rolled every screen wrap.

    When you want the raindrop to stop spawning, use the stop command.

    TODO:
    X -- Make raindrop, lmao
    -- Successful screen wrap and loop.
    X -- Randomized x-location and height ratio.
